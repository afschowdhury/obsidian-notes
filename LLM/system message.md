the system message sets the persona or the main objective of the model or chatbot. 
A system message is a special message that tells a large language model (LLM) what to do and how to do it. A system message helps the LLM to perform better and avoid mistakes. For example, a system message can tell the LLM what kind of task it should do, what kind of language it should use, what kind of format it should follow, and what kind of examples it should look at. A system message can also tell the LLM what not to do, like talking about things that are not related to the task or making harmful or wrong statements. A system message is usually written by a developer who knows how to use the LLM and wants to create an application with it. A system message is not meant for humans to read, but for the LLM to read and follow.
