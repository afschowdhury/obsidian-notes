A chain that runs multiple [[LLMChain]] in sequence, **passing the output of one chain as the input of the next one.** <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">This chain can be used for any task that involves applying multiple transformations or operations to an input, such as data cleaning, data augmentation, data analysis, etc. For example, you can use a SimpleSequentialChain to create a pipeline that takes a raw text input, cleans it, translates it to another language, and summarizes it
