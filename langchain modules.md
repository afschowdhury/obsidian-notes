[[langchain]] is a python module that helps building NLP application with ease

the modules are :


- Models: This module provides support for various model types and model integrations, such as GPT-3, OpenAI Codex, and Hugging Face
- Prompts: This module provides support for **prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization**, which are essential for working with language models
- Memory: This module provides support for memory, which is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain or an agent. It provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains or agents that use memory
- Indexes: This module provides support for indexes, which are ways of combining language models with your own text data. It covers best practices for creating and using indexes¹.
- Chains: This module provides support for chains, which are sequences of calls to a language model or a different utility. It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications such as question answering and chatbots
- Agents: This module provides support for agents, which are language models that make decisions about which actions to take, take those actions, see an observation, and repeat that until done. It provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents such as GPT+WolframAlpha and AutoGPT¹².
