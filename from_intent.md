#rasa 


as the name specifies, the value of the slots will be set to a specific value ( `value: my_value` in the example ) when the assistant will predict a particular intent which is set by  [[slots mapping configurations#intent: only applies the mapping when this intent is predicted.]]. It also provides [[slots mapping configurations#not_intent: does not apply the mapping when this intent is predicted.]]
