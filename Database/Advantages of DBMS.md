 DBMS helps in efficient organization of data in database which has following advantages over typical file system:

-   **Minimized redundancy and data inconsistency:** Data is normalized in DBMS to minimize the redundancy which helps in keeping data consistent. For Example, student information can be kept at one place in DBMS and accessed by different users.This minimized redundancy is due to primary key and foreign keys
-   **Simplified Data Access:** A user need only name of the relation not exact location to access data, so the process is very simple.
-   **Multiple data views:** Different views of same data can be created to cater the needs of different users. For Example, faculty salary information can be hidden from student view of data but shown in admin view.
-   **Data Security:** Only authorized users are allowed to access the data in DBMS. Also, data can be encrypted by DBMS which makes it secure.
-   **Concurrent access to data:** Data can be accessed concurrently by different users at same time in DBMS.
-   **Backup and Recovery mechanism:** DBMS backup and recovery mechanism helps to avoid data loss and data inconsistency in case of catastrophic failures.
