Sentence transformers provides a utility function called `semantic_search` that allows you to perform semantic similarity search on a dataset of sentences. This function uses the embeddings generated by the Sentence transformers model to compute the semantic similarity between a given query sentence and a set of candidate sentences.

Faiss, on the other hand, is a library that provides a set of algorithms and index structures for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It can be used to search for similar vectors in a large dataset and find the nearest neighbors of a given vector in a high-dimensional space. Faiss can be used with any type of vectors, including the embeddings generated by Sentence transformers or other NLP models.

So, if you want to perform semantic similarity search using Sentence transformers, you can use the `semantic_search` utility function. If you want to perform similarity search or clustering on a large dataset of vectors, you can use Faiss. You can also use both tools together by generating embeddings for your sentences using Sentence transformers and then using Faiss to perform similarity search or clustering on the embeddings
