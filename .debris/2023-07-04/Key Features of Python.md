### **What are the key features of Python?**

-   Python is an  [[Interpreted Language]]. That means that, unlike languages like _C_ and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include _PHP_ and _Ruby_.
-   [[Python is Dynamically Typed]] 
-   Python is well suited to [**object orientated programming**](https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-class/) in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++’s `public`, `private`).
-   In Python, **functions** are **first-class objects**. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects
-   **Writing Python code is quick** but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately，Python allows the inclusion of C-based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The [numpy](https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-numpy-tutorial/) package is a good example of this, it’s really quite quick because a lot of the number-crunching it does isn’t actually done by Python
-   Python finds **use in many spheres** – web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big data applications and many more. It’s also often used as “glue” code to get other languages and components to play nice.
