A Python virtual machine (PVM) is a software-based virtual environment that runs Python code and programs. It is a virtualization layer that enables the execution of Python bytecode in a platform-agnostic manner, providing an abstraction from the underlying hardware and operating system. The PVM provides an isolated execution environment, allowing multiple programs to run simultaneously without interfering with each other. It acts as an interpreter, converting Python code into machine-readable instructions and executing them accordingly. The PVM also manages memory allocation and garbage collection, ensuring efficient use of system resources. In essence, the Python virtual machine provides the necessary infrastructure for executing Python programs and ensures compatibility across different platforms and environments
