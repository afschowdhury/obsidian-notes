[[YML]] is a human-readable data serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files, data exchange, and other applications that need structured data. YAML stands for **YAML Ain’t Markup Language**, which emphasizes that YAML is not a document markup language like HTML or XML, but a data format that can represent complex data structures.

Some of the reasons why we need YAML are:

- YAML is easy to read and write, with a minimalist syntax that uses indentation and keywords to define the structure and type of data.
- YAML is compatible with JSON, which means that any valid JSON document is also a valid YAML document, and vice versa. YAML also supports comments, which JSON does not.
- YAML allows advanced features such as extensible data types, relational anchors, and mapping types preserving key order, which can be useful for creating complex and dynamic data structures.
- YAML is widely supported by many programming languages and tools, such as<span style="background:#ff4d4f"> Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, Jupyter Notebook</span>, etc.
