| A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters | An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions |
| In this language, once the program is compiled it is expressed in the instructions of the target machine         | While in this language, the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine                                                                                                    |
| There are at least two steps to get from source code to execution                                                | There is only one step to get from source code to execution.                                                                                                                                |
| In this language, compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs                                         | While in this language, interpreted programs can be modified while the program is running                                                                                                   |
| In this language, compilation errors prevent the code from compiling.                                            | In this languages, all the debugging occurs at run-time.                                                                                                                                    |
|                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The code of compiled language can be executed directly by the computer’s CPU.                                    | A program written in an interpreted language is not compiled, it is interpreted.                                                                                                            |
| This language delivers better performance.                                                                       | This language example delivers relatively slower performance.                                                                                                                               |
