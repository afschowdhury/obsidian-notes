look up tables are the list or the collection of words that can be mapped into a single entity. for example, we can have all the countries name in the lookup example and when we will come across any of this country, the text will be automatically be recognized as entity `country` it is defined in the lookup section in the [[NLU]] file

similar to [[synonyms]] we first introduce the unique entity name ( here `country`  as an example) and in the examples , we list out all the country names.
