#langchain #nlp 

Python langchain module is a library that provides out-of-the-box support to build NLP applications using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT¹. It helps you build GPT-powered applications in minutes¹. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory¹². LangChain also provides support for prompts, indexes, chains, agents, and various use cases such as question answering, chatbots, personal assistants, and autonomous agents³⁴.
