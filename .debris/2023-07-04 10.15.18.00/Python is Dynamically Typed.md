Python is **dynamically typed**, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like `x=111` and then `x="I'm a string"`
without error.

Also , it is strongly typed. For example, if we want to print 
`"1" +1`  it will raise an error. Because, we can't really add an string to an integer. In there are some weakly typed language like [[JavaScript]] . the above expression will run without and error and the second 1 will get converted to the same datatype as the first one, and we will get `11` as output
