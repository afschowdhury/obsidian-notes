 Data is more like document. This is used where data scalability is essential
 

  Document databases offer a variety of advantages, including:-   An intuitive data model that is fast and easy for developers to work with.
   -   A flexible schema that allows for the data model to evolve as application needs change.
-   The ability to horizontally scale out.

Document databases are considered to be non-relational (orÂ [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/types-of-nosql-databases)) databases. Instead of storing data in fixed rows and columns, document databases use flexible documents. Document databases are the most popular alternative to tabular, relational databases


Example :
1. [[MongoDB]]
2. [[Apache CouchDB]]
3. [[Fireabase]]
