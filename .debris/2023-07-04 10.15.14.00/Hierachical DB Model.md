It is a fairly old data model and primarily used by IBM in 60s and 70s. But, today we don't see them very often as it lacks of efficiencies. 

- Stores data in tree like structure
- has a parent child relationship
	- one parent can have multiple children
	- one child can have only one parent

- useful in describing [[one to many ]] relationship
