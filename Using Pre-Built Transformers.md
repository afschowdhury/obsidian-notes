As, we already know, it is a part of NER, we can use pre-built models and here, we will not need any training data. Duckling( a pre-trained model) is already good at extracting numbers, dates , URL, email addresses from text and SpaCy for extracting names, locations etc. 

We only need to specify pre-build models that we are using in nlu configurations file.
