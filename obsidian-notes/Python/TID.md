A TID, or thread ID, is a unique identifier assigned to a single execution path or sequence of instructions within a program. It is used to differentiate between different threads of execution within a single process, allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously and independently. A TID is usually assigned by the operating system when a new thread is created and can be used by the system to manage and monitor the execution of the thread, such as allocating and deallocating resources, controlling scheduling, and handling errors and exceptions.
