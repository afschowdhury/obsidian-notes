![[Pasted image 20230207114526.png]]
it is a type of [[Multi-tasking in python]] and known as [[2. Thread based Multitasking]]


In general  , whern we write a program , it creates an object and it runs in the main thread. but, if we want to reduce the time or optimize the time, we can use threding, to enable parallel execution. here, we would need more memory as the thread would require more memory just like the example of real life where teacher is a thread and hall is memory . 

## What is thread 
- thread is an object of the operating system that executes the program . 
- it is a separate flow of execution in the program 
- every thread represents a task and the task may include sub programs .
