Rules are more compact of [[Rasa/STORIES]]. Here is a conditional conversation flow represented. For example , whenever the chat bot will understand the user has expressed ***goodbye*** intent, the **urrer_goodbye** action will be taken.

very traditional. 

>RULES are the way to describe short pieces of conversation that always goes in the same way. 


[[Rasa/STORIES]] are long form of conversation, and it is for the machine learning algorithm to learn from and rules are for short form of conversation, when, the flow is very predicted, and we don't need any machine learning here (neither used in machine learning training nor needed )

For example,

here, the chat bot will say goodbye if the user says goodbye. Nothing fancy, nothing else, and it is captured by the rules.
