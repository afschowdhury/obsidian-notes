### Relational Database

If a [[Database/DATABASE]] follows [[13 rules of codd]] then it will be regarded as [[Relational Database]] Model.

- Data is stored in tabular form - *( columns and rows)* just like in the spreadsheet *( google sheets / excel sheets)*
- column contains item properties ( attributes ) such as Last Name, First name
- A table ( composed of rows and columns) in a relational database is a collection of related things just like an individual spreadsheet.  ( Employees, Sales etc)

- In a relational database, we can form relationships between tables

**Examples**

1. PostgreSQL
2. MySQL
3. Microsoft SQL server

Relational database  works well with  [[SQL]]
