Like most of the programming languages , it is of two types. 
1. Single line comment
2. Multi line  comment

### Single Line Comment

`--` is used to dictate a single line comment

```sql
-- this is a single line comment
select * from tablename -- this is another comment 
```

## Multiline comment
`/**/` is used to denote a multiline comment. the content goes in between the stars

```sql
/*
this is a example of multiline comment
this is another line

*/
select * from tablename -- this is a comment 
```
