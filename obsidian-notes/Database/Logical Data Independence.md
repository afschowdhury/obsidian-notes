## Logical Data Independence

Logical Data Independence is the ability to change the conceptual scheme without changing

1.  External views
2.  External API or programs

Any change made will be absorbed by the mapping between external and conceptual levels.

When compared to Physical Data independence, it is challenging to achieve logical data independence.

### Examples of changes under Logical Data Independence

Due to Logical independence, any of the below change will not affect the external layer.

1.  Add/Modify/Delete a new attribute, entity or relationship is possible without a rewrite of existing application programs
2.  Merging two records into one
3.  Breaking an existing record into two or more records
