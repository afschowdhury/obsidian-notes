Imagine you have a magic friend who can talk to you and answer your questions. Sometimes, you ask your friend to tell you something in a special way, like a list, a number, or a date. For example, you might ask your friend to tell you the names of all the planets, or how many fingers you have, or what day it is today. Your friend is very smart and can understand what you want, but sometimes they need some help to tell you the answer in the right way. That's why they have another friend called an output parser. An output parser is a helper who can take the answer from your magic friend and make it look nice and neat for you. For example, if your magic friend tells you the names of all the planets as a long sentence, the output parser can make it into a list with commas and bullets. Or if your magic friend tells you how many fingers you have as a word, the output parser can make it into a number. Or if your magic friend tells you what day it is today as a long word, the output parser can make it into a date with slashes. The output parser knows how to do this because they have some rules that tell them how to change the answer from your magic friend. Sometimes, they also ask your magic friend to repeat or fix their answer if it doesn't follow the rules. LangChain is a tool that lets you use different kinds of magic friends who can talk to you and answer your questions. They are called language models and they can do amazing things with words. LangChain also has different kinds of output parsers who can help you get the answers in the way you want. They are called output parsers and they can do amazing things with formats. You can use LangChain to ask your magic friends and their helpers anything you want and get nice and neat answers back.

> It is used to format the output in the way we want or in other words , it parses the output in our defined way
