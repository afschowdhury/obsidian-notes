TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document or a collection of documents. It is often used in information retrieval and natural language processing tasks to determine the relevance of a document to a given query.

TF-IDF is calculated as the product of two terms: the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF). The term frequency is the number of times a particular word appears in a document. The inverse document frequency is a measure of the rarity of the word in the collection of documents.

The TF-IDF score for a word in a document is higher if the word appears frequently in the document and is rare in the collection of documents. This reflects the idea that a word that appears frequently in a single document is likely to be more important to the meaning of that document than a word that appears less frequently or is more common in the collection as a whole.

TF-IDF is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval tasks, such as search engines, to rank the relevance of documents to a given query. It can also be used as a feature in machine learning models for various NLP tasks, such as text classification and clustering.
