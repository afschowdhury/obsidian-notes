## **What is Interpreted Language?**

An interpreted language is a programming language that is generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program. Interpreted language ranges – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.
